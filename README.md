## Jets Project

### Week 2 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

#### OverView
This program displays and manages a fleet of Jet objects. A list of planes will be displayed with different specifications. The user will be able to see all the planes or choose different criteria for viewing the planes. The program will allow the user to input their own planes into the fleet. 

##### Technologies Used
Created a main that included an array of jets and included a while loop and a switch statement for cycling through the user menu. Multiple classes were created that used a SuperClass and SubClasses. Interfaces were implemented throughout the subclasses. Multiple methods were used for calling different actions throughout the program with for loops and if statements. DecimalFormat was imported to correct the decimal when printing out numerical stats.

###### Lessons Learned
Be careful when using Eclipse to import methods, Superclass, getters and setters, etc. It might import something you do not need that throws off the program and makes troubleshooting difficult. Do not assume the program is going to work as you think, it might not and then you panic trying to meet a deadline.
